# Age estimation using AI on 12-lead ECGs

### Reproduce experiments
To reproduce the experiments in this GitHub repository, you should run the Jupyter Notebooks in the following order:

* hyperparameter_optimization.ipynb [not started on yet]
* cross_validation.ipynb
* final_training.ipynb
* testset_performance.ipynb
* testset_and_XAI.ipynb [not started on yet]

In addition there are two notebooks with the purpose of doing exploratory data analysis on the training and testset

* EDA_training.ipynb [not started on yet]
* EDA_test.ipynb [not started on yet]

### Run Jupyter Notebooks in Google Colab
To run the Jupyter Notebooks you will need GPUs. For those of you who don't have your own GPU, we thought that it would be convenient to use free GPUs from Google.

The easyest way to open the Jupyter Notebooks from this GitHub repository in Google Colab is to:

1. Use a Google Chrome browser
2. Install the Google Colab extention: https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/open-in-colab/iogfkhleblhcpcekbiedikdehleodpjo
3. Click on the Notebook, in this GitHub repository, you want to open
4. Finally click on your new Google Colab extention right underneath the tabs in your Google Chrome browser.
