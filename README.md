# Age estimation using AI on 12-lead ECGs

### Reproduce experiments
To reproduce the experiments in this GitHub repository, you should run the Jupyter Notebooks in the following order:

* cross_validation.ipynb
* final_training.ipynb
* testset_performance.ipynb

### Run Jupyter Notebooks in Google Colab
To run the Jupyter Notebooks you will need GPUs. For those of you who don't have your own GPU, we thought that it would be convenient to use free GPUs from Google.

The easiest way to open the Jupyter Notebooks from this GitHub repository in Google Colab is to:

1. Use a Google Chrome browser
2. Install the Google Colab extention: https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/open-in-colab/iogfkhleblhcpcekbiedikdehleodpjo
3. Click on the Notebook, in this GitHub repository, you want to open
4. Finally click on your new Google Colab extention right underneath the tabs in your Google Chrome browser.
